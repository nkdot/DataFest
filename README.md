# DataFest
DataFest conducted by American statistical association

I got an opportunity to work with real-time data developed by Yale school of medicine in DataFest2022. We were given a dataset that had log details of 166 
players taken from an online educational game called Elm city stories. It was designed to prevent negative health outcomes in young at-risk teens by increasing 
their perception of risk and aquiring healthy skills to prevent engaging in risky behavior. The game had different levels. 

This was one of the more open-ended and complex challenges DataFest has provided. The researchers who created the game have had very few opportunities to examine the log data, and I was one among many contestants to take a serious look at it. I had 2 days to analyse and prepare the report.

My job was to characterize, measure, observe, and display patterns of play within each level by different players. I measured the total time spent by each player in each stack and tried to identify the pattern of play among different players using data visualization. and I also performed statistical testing to identify any significant difference in their performance across different levels/stacks. I received best statistical analysis award for my work.
